- The Fulfill Order screen displays the full contents of customer-provided notes (when there is one) instead of cutting them off after single line, so you can see all the detail on one screen.
- The count on the Orders tab bar now correctly refreshes when you switch between stores.
- Quirks are intriguing in people and a lot less intriguing in apps, so we took care of a few bugs that caused some visual quirks (in particular, when changing system font sizes).
